# SARS-CoV-2 X-Rays(DX) detection

This repository provides a model for COVID-19 detection for educational purposes only, based on the VGG16 convolutional neural network model. The model currently has 98% accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset was collected from :
 - [Database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray and CT images](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
 - [Chest X-Ray Images/Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data)
